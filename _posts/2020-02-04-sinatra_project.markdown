Working on the Sinatra project was a tough endeavor for me. Trying to figure out how the paths should work was very stressful yet meaningful. I would find myself staring hours at my screen thinking of what I did wrong. Thankfully I used the study group sessions and slack to help me achieve the completion of my project.

My project application is called The Sneaker Closet in which the user can add the sneakers they have in their collection and make changes to it. For example if they sold or threw away their sneakers they can easily edit and make those changes in the app.

I can't wait to continue on my journey and to conquer the next project the curse has for me!
