For the past three years I was working as a entry level budget analyst and then latterally transitioned over as a FP&A analyst within a media agency. I felt that I was not fulfuilling my potential in the role and the only program I knew well was Microsoft Exel. I wanted to learn coding to stay competitive since as a FP&A analyst I was bombarded with tons of financial data and knew that I needed to learn more tools to be able to properly examine and organize big data.
