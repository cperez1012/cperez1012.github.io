I'm so close to completing my course work that I could already see the finish line tape! Whenever I feel stuck on my final portfolio project, I like to revisit some of my past projects and I'm amazed as to how far I have come since building those projects. Of course I begin to refactor certain lines of code to follow the DRY principle of not repeating myself, but I just love making my projects look as nice and appealing to the human eye as possible. Since when I completed those projects in the first place, I was only worried about having the MVP (minimal viable product) in order to satisfy the project minimum requirements. Now since I have time to go over what I completed a long time ago, I feel excited to use CSS styling and Boostrap in order to make my past projects presentable for potential employers. One of my favorite things so far is to create a app logo for my project and paste it onto my code which gives it a nice personal touch!
