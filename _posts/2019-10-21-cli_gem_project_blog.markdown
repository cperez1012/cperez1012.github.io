When I first started on my CLI Gem portfolio project, I was very overwhelmed with how I was going to tackle this project. Luckily by using the instructional videos that are posted on the Learn-Instruct page, I knew how I needed to start.  I followed closely as to how Beth Schofield worked on her CLI Eden Project demonstration. I picked up valuable information on how to attack this project by first using written data before using the scraped data in order to know if the CLI program will work smoothley. There were many times I was frustrated especially when working in the Learn IDE sandbox and not saving my work before the page cleared. On the bright side, the essential things needed to start a program in ruby are now in-grained in my mind through these mishaps. 

My CLI project is based on the user seeing a list of upcoming sneakers provided from a sneaker release website and typing the lnumber listed that correlates to the sneaker in order to get the release date for that sneaker. Once the user chooses the sneaker a message pops up that has the sneaker brand, shoe name, and release date for that sneaker. working through this project embolden to never give up and always ask for guidance when struggling on an issue that may seem complex.
